       The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can reliably predict whether a vehicle has an automatic or manual transmission. 
        By leveraging this model, Go Auto aims to enhance its decision-making processes, streamline inventory classification, and target marketing efforts more effectively. 
        A successful model would not only improve operational efficiency but also provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, helping dealerships better align their offerings with market demand. 
        The ability to accurately identify the transmission type can contribute significantly to improving customer experiences and boosting sales.

We examined the distribution of numerical features such as vehicle year, price, and mileage, while also exploring relationships between categorical features like make, model, and dealer information.
            The EDA revealed key patterns and correlations in the data, such as newer vehicles and specific brands being more likely to have automatic transmissions. Visualizations, including bar charts and heatmaps, effectively highlighted these insights.

The process began by selecting a diverse range of models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. To handle missing values, a `SimpleImputer` was employed to replace them with a constant (0), ensuring consistency across all folds of the training data. Each model was incorporated into a pipeline alongside the imputer, streamlining the preprocessing and training stages.
        To ensure robust evaluation, 5-fold cross-validation was conducted for each pipeline. This method split the data into training and testing subsets in multiple iterations, calculating the accuracy for each fold. The mean and standard deviation of these accuracy scores provided insights into the performance and stability of the models. The results were stored systematically, allowing for easy comparison and enabling the selection of the most effective classifier for the dataset. This approach ensured fairness in evaluation and enhanced the reliability of the chosen model.
